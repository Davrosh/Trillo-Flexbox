  /*   But if the height can be bigger than that then it will simply be bigger
       You may want to use min-height a lot in order to ensure that elements
       stay above the mobile-best-look threshold, but can scale up as the
       viewport becomes larger. 
       Just putting height here seems fine at first, but scale the browser
       window up and if the content doesn't fit the viewport it overflows from
       it - in this case, we see that the background persists until the end of
       the viewport and not after scrolling down.
